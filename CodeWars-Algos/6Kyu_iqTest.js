// Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test is to find out which one of the given numbers differs from the others.
// Bob observed that one number usually differs from the others in evenness.
// Help Bob â€” to check his answers, he needs a program that among the given numbers finds one that is different in evenness, and return a position of this number.

// ! Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a real IQ test, which means indexes of the elements start from 1 (not 0)

// iqTest("2 4 7 8 10") => 3 // Third number is odd, while the rest of the numbers are even

// iqTest("1 2 1 1") => 2 // Second number is even, while the rest of the numbers are odd

// NOT FINISHED!
// NOT FINISHED!
// NOT FINISHED!
// NOT FINISHED!
// NOT FINISHED!

const iqTest = (numbers) => {
  return numbers
    .split(" ")
    .map((number, index) => {
      if (number % 2 === 1) {
        return index + 1;
      } 
      console.log(number, index)
    }).join("")
};

console.log(iqTest("1 2 1 1"));
